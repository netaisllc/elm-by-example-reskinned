# Requirements
----------
Very little is need to work the examples on this site. In fact, you can
simply read along and benefit from the code samples and commentary.

But to make the most of your time, do one of the following:

* Work the examples in Elm's online development environment

* Install Elm, fork the code samples, and work each of them locally.

## Elm's Online Development Environment

The Elm project maintains a cool, [online dev site](http://elm-lang.org/try) that you can use to
quickly write Elm and experience its output. All you need is a browser
to get stated with Elm.

## Installing Elm

Installing Elm isn't difficult, but it's outside the scope of this site.
Refer to the instructions [here](http://elm-lang.org/install) to install on
Mac or Windows hosts, **or** if you wish to use Elm on Linux by building the
project locally.

To use Elm on Linux **without** building the project locally - that is, to
install it via an _installer-based_ method - use
[this npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm). (Note that
this method depends on NodeJS and npm.)

## Forking the Code Samples

Fork the code samples [here](https://github.com/grzegorzbalcerek/ElmByExample),
and use them locally to explore and learn.

## Elm's Dependency on Git

The Elm project includes its own package-manager, **elm package**, that is
used to acquire and manage re-usable Elm code you want to leverage in your projects.

You don't need to worry about this to simply get started with Elm. However, any
Elm project of sufficient size is going to use elm packages. It's how modularity
and code-reuse happens in the Elm eco-system.  Be sure you have **git** installed
on your development host so you can effortlessly install elm packages.
