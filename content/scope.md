# Scope
----------
This version targets Elm core version **0.15.1**.

Elm continues to improve its API, expressiveness and approachability to developers
without a background in functional programming.

While the tutorial author strives to keep this content up-to-date with Elm
latest, there are no hard-and-fast guarantees about accuracy or fitness-to-use.

## Publishing Process

The content herein is based on the original work of
[Grzegorz Balcerek](http://github.com/grzegorzbalcerek/ElmByExample). On a
periodic basis, content from that site is acquired and reformatted for
display in this app.

There may, at times, be an unavoidable time lag between updates to Elm,
Elm-By-Example, and this site.
