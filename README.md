# Reskinning Elm By Example

This project serve two purposes:

1. A decent test case for my personal exploration of the [Elm language](http://elm-lang.org)
2. Adding some materialistic UI to a free, tutorial site regarding Elm to make it more pleasant to use.

This projects is a single-page app implemented with Elm.

You'll note it's not a very _good_ Elm app, rather it's a very _first_ Elm app.  So it is full of anti-patterns and confusing technique.  

For that I apologize, but we are all beginners at the start, except for maybe EvanCz (the 'force' behind Elm lang).
